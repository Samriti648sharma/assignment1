      "question": "How to identify a driver and vehicle?",
      "answer": "When you request a ride, your app sends your request to nearby drivers. After you're matched with a driver, your app shares info about the vehicle and driver headed to your pickup location. Tap the bar that includes the driverâ€™s name, photo, and vehicle. This displays a photo of your driver along with the vehicle's make, model, and license plate number.When you see your driver's vehicle at your pickup location, confirm that the license plate number displayed in your app matches the actual vehicle. Drivers will often ask your name before starting the trip. "
